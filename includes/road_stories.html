              Depending on how much time you have: if you do Backpacking in
              South America the long-distance bus is the cheapest but slowest
              option, via plane it's much faster.<br /><br />
              The nearest airport is located in El Calafate which offers direct
              flight connections to Buenos Aires regularly – Aerolíneas
              Argentinas has usually the best deals traveling within Argentina.
              From El Calafate you can go by bus to El Chalten in about 2,5h.
              But: use the time in Calafate to withdraw money as you'll find
              only 2 ATMs in El Chalten which often run out of money in peak
              season.<br /><br />
              The best time for trekking in El Chalten is in summer – the season
              starts in October and lasts until April. Before and after the
              season most hostels/hotels and restaurants are closed.<br /><br />
              You should definitely stay in the relaxed village of El Chaltén
              rather than the busy and more touristy El Calafate. Though the
              Internet connection is bad and most Hostels don't offer breakfast
              it is much more enjoyable and you're right at the starting point
              for all treks.<br /><br />
              I stayed at the Hostel Aylen Aike on my first visit and highly
              recommend it for budget travelers as the owner is awesome and
              loves helping you out in planning and organizing your treks or
              even climbs – the hostel offers small and big dorms and is nicely
              located.<br /><br />
              During my last visit I stayed at Lo de Guille, a family run B&B
              (one of the few places in El Chaltén which offers a basic
              breakfast). Very friendly staff & affordable prices, comes with a
              locked storage room (to use when you are trekking) and a kitchen
              for everyone to use.<br /><br />
              In case the Aylen Aike or Lo de Guille is booked out for your
              dates make sure to check out the other Hostels listed on
              Hostelworld or have a look at the El Chaltén overview page on
              Booking for other options such as B&B's and Hotels. I highly
              recommend booking in advance as spaces fill up quickly during the
              hiking season!<br /><br />
              This is an easy day hike where you don't have to be an experience
              hiker – take some sunscreen, water and food. After around 3h
              you'll be at the Laguna Torre.<br /><br />
              The starting point is located south-west of El Chalten next to the
              river Rio Fitz Roy. The trail is well marked and ascends smoothly
              from El Chaltén.<br /><br />
              After around 1h you'll arrive at the viewpoint “Mirador Torre”
              form where you are able to see the towers for the first time.
              Follow the trail downhill and through flat terrain following the
              signs “Laguna Torre” until you arrive at the lagoon.<br /><br />
              You made it – enjoy the view! From here you have 2 possibilities
              to get closer to the glacier: left across the gravel or right to
              the viewpoint “Mirador Meastri”.<br /><br />
              The most beautiful trail gets you close to the Monte Fitz Roy, the
              destination is called “Laguna de los Tres”. You should start at
              dawn in El Chalten to avoid the day tourists from Calafate. Be
              prepared as the trail is pretty tough at the end!<br /><br />
              The starting point can be found in the north-west of El Chalten
              and is hard to miss (big signs). From there the only way is up,
              after 1h you reach the viewpoint “Mirador Fitz Roy” (left hand
              side). Continue after a little break and follow the signs to the
              Camp “Poincenot”.<br /><br />
              After a flat section you'll arrive at the camp which you have to
              cross – then you cross some small rivers and get to the final and
              steepest part (use the chance to fill your water bottle at the
              river). Follow the steep trail over huge rocks up to the
              lagoon.<br /><br />
              Isn't it beautiful up here? Enjoy the view and use the chance to
              go to the small hill left hand side of the “Laguna de los Tres” to
              see another lagoon: the “Laguna Sucia”!<br /><br />
              Due to the well marked hiking trails you can easily connect both
              treks to a multi-day itinerary with camping.<br /><br />
              Day 1: Follow the instruction in 4) and leave your equipment at
              the Camp Poincenot before heading up to Laguna de los Tres, enjoy
              your day up there and spend the night at the camp.<br /><br />
              Day 2: Take it easy in the morning and head in the direction of El
              Chalten, shortly afterwards you'll get to a junction which you
              have to follow right to “Laguna Torre”. The distance to Laguna
              Torre is about 7km, easy doable in around 2h – the trail leads you
              through flat terrain passing Laguna Madre, Laguna Hija and Laguna
              Nieta. At the next big junction you keep right and arrive at
              Laguna Torre at lunch.<br /><br />
              If you want you can extend for a 3rd day by camping at the nearby
              Camp “De Agostini” – or you head back to El Chalten (3h).

              monasteries of San Millán de la Cogolla, a World Heritage site
              considered the birthplace of the Spanish language. Stop for a wine
              tasting at a local bodega before settling in to our hotel. (8
              miles hiking, 4 hours).<br /><br />DAY 3: ATAPUERCA/BURGOS<br /><br />Today’s
              route rises onto the Meseta Central, high plains that stretch
              across much of central Spain. Pick up the trail in Atapuerca and
              head towards Burgos. Walk into the center of the ninth-century
              city, a former capital of the kingdom of Castile and home to the
              Spanish national hero El Cid. Take a guided tour of the old town
              and its 13th-century Gothic cathedral, a World Heritage site.
              (12–13 miles hiking, 5–6 hours).<br /><br />DAY 4:
              FROMISTA/CARRIÓN DE LOS CONDES<br /><br />Transfer to Fromista,
              then continue across the Meseta, rambling through the endless
              green and gold fields of the Tierra de Campos. This land is filled
              with the history of La Reconquista, when Christian kingdoms
              succeeded in retaking areas of the Iberian Peninsula controlled by
              Moors. Arrive in the town of Carrión de los Condes, and stay the
              night in a historic monastery. (11 miles, 5 hours hiking).<br /><br />DAY
              5: SAHAGÚN/BERCIANOS DEL CAMINO/LEÓN<br /><br />Start off from the
              medieval city of Sahagún and head west to the village of Bercianos
              del Real Camino. Drive on to León for lunch and spend the
              afternoon discovering the city’s historic sites, including a
              guided visit through its remarkable cathedral, filled with more
              than a hundred stained glass windows. Enjoy dinner on your own
              this evening, and spend the night in a spectacular Renaissance
              convent. (5–6 miles hiking, 3 hours).

              The Golan Trail is a marked path that stretches for 120 kilometers
              with breathtaking scenery. Hikers on the Golan Trail can see views
              of Mt. Hermon and Lake Kinneret, volcanos and reservoirs,
              wildflowers and archaeological sites. The trail begins in the
              north on Mt. Hermon, and ends with a view of Lake Kinneret in the
              south; the path is marked with blue, white and green stripes. The
              Golan Trail has become a popular “pilgrimage hike” in recent
              years.<br /><br />
              The recommended season for hiking the trail is spring, especially
              the months of March and April. At this time of year, the Golan is
              “painted” green, and wildflower blooming is at its peak. The
              southern segments of the Golan Trail can be hiked in the winter
              (from October to February), too. Since this area is about 300-400
              meters above sea level, the winters are relatively mild (except
              for rainy days). The northern segments can be hiked in May,
              throughout the summer, and again in September. Most of the
              northern segments are at a height of 1,000 meters above sea level,
              and the summers are relatively mild; many of the segments are
              heavily shaded.<br /><br />The Golan Trail is divided into 15
              segments of different lengths, all between 6 and 11 kilometers per
              segment. Each segment has a starting and ending point that is
              accessible by car; if there are two cars, one can be left at the
              end for convenience.<br /><br />People still hitchhike safely in
              the Golan, but there is also public transportation that can help
              hikers at the beginning and ending of most trails.<br /><br />Each
              segment can be hiked in a day or less, and the difficulty level is
              usually easy-to-intermediate. Advanced hikers can finish two
              segments per day (we don’t recommend hiking any more than two
              segments at a time).<br /><br />For those hiking “with their homes
              on their backs”, the Golan Trail usually takes about 7-9 days to
              finish; there are free camping sites along the way. But the Golan
              also offers many diverse kinds of lodgings: one can stay at a paid
              campsite with minimum creature comforts, or one can stay at a
              fancy B and B; both options can be found relatively near the
              trail.<br /><br />For those hiking the Golan Trail, one must have
              an updated version of Trail Map #1 (the map with the official
              trails marked clearly), which is updated from time to time.
              Another possibility is to have an app on your smartphone that
              includes the same trail markings and information that are on the
              physical map.<br /><br />While hiking in the Golan, it is
              absolutely forbidden to cross fences or go off the marked trail;
              in a number of places, the trail is not far from well-signed
              minefields (which are all marked on official maps and apps).
